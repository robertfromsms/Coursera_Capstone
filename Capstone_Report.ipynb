Of course, high population and low competition neighborhood is the most ideal location to establish the tacos and burritos restaurant. At the end, we aim to provide recommendations of best neighborhoods for our tacos and burritos restaurant."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Target Audience"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Entrepreneurs interested in establishing a taco and burrito restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia.
